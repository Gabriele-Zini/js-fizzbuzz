## EXERCISE

Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100 to the console, but for multiples of 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print 'Buzz'. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz'

### SOLUTION


**Program Logic**

Set up a for loop from 1 to 100 with three conditions.

1. The first condition is for numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5; set the boolean operator in the condition, and print 'FizzBuzz'.

2. The second condition is for numbers that are multiples only of 3 print 'Fizz'.

3. The third condition is for numbers that are multiples only of 5 print 'Buzz'.

4. In the else statement, print 'i'.
